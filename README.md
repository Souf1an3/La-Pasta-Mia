## What is this about?

La Pasta Mia is a fully responsive Recipe collector and grocery handling  CRUD application with React and Spring Boot from different servers. 

You can record very detailed recipes to your collection and search them by different filters very easily, you can add/delete/move grocery list items, even from recipes.
The application aimed to be very clean, fast and task oriented. 

I created this application in the final Advanced Room in my Codecool bootcamp journey when I was learning about Spring Boot and React.

## Techs I used

- Backend : Spring Boot with JPA and Hibernate for ORM
- Frontend : React.js and some CSS
- Development: IntelliJ Idea and Webstorm, Postman, Chrome DevTools

- Noteable libarys: Material UI for React components and Cloudinary API for image uploading
